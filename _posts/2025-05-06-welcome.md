Here, you've arrived at one of the many nodes scattered across the vast network — this one offering a defensive perspective. Through my lens, you'll catch glimpses of cybersecurity in practice: blue team strategies, defensive insights, and reflections from the trenches. Take what you need, stay curious, or drift onward to other nodes — the Net is wide.


If you are curious about why and how I got into studying and practicing IT security, feel free to check out my [About page][about].

I tried to make this blog both clean and visually slick, while keeping the content focused and technical, if you spot any mistakes, do not hesitate to reach out by email (and please include any sources or references if you are pointing something out) : sentry42@proton.me. I will try my best to keep my content reliable.

Thank you
