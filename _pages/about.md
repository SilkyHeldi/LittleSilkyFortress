Welcome to The Watch Node, where I share my firsthand IT security encounters and insights.
As I navigate this intricate world, I will try my best to catalog and refine the various experiences and CTFs (Capture the flag) I am going to practice / explore.

My fascination for cybersecurity, and especially blue teaming, ignited during a conference held by incident responders unraveling the aftermath of an attack on a renowned French corporation. Though much of it remained a puzzle, it was enough to awaken a sense of wonder within me.

My initiation into the world of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges commenced with HTBUniversity2022, where my team soared to an impressive 4th place globally, outshining 2500+ formidable competitor teams. This experience propelled me into the role of President at APT42, the 42Paris infosec association (not the real APT okay). Here, I delved into an array of activities â€“ from immersive workshops to spirited CTF competitions and peer-to-peer learning, offering a glimpse into the expansive realm of cybersecurity.

Yet, the exploration has just begun. As of November 2023, I successfully concluded my last common-core project at 42Paris, freeing me to delve deeper into the vast expanse of cybersecurity. A year later, I finished my first internship within a dominant and information sensitive satellite company. There, I explored all the roles of a security operations team and developped some taste for threat hunting and threat intelligence !

With an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and a commitment to excellence, I am set to devote the majority of my time to intensive practice and reading, striving to become good enough to be able to defend against even the most sophisticated threats !
