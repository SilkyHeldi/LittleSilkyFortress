      The allied organisation Nuclear Punk, which was attacked by the entity, has provided us with its logs to help us understand the techniques used by the attackers, as well as the various compromise vectors exploited.
      <br>
      <br>
      To identify the attacking group, you need to recover the request that enabled the attacker to successfully use the first vulnerability in the application, the name of the vulnerability (in the format below) used by the attacker to execute the command, the IP address of the server used by the attacker and the exact location of the file that enables persistence.

## Recon

We have a compromised server logs and must identify 4 things :
- the first vulnerability used by the attacker
- the second vulnerability
- the IP the tools are from
- the path of the persistence file
